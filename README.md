# ü¶à Shark Space ‚Äì NASA AI Ocean Explorer

Shark Space is an interactive application developed to explore and visualize ocean environmental and shark behavioral data based on NASA partner missions and satellites such as PACE, MODIS-Aqua, and SWOT. The project combines data science, interactive visualization, and gamification to make ocean studies more accessible and educational.

## üåç About the Project

# ü¶à Sharks-from-Space: Bayesian Predictive Model of Feeding Hotspots

## **üåêOverview**

This project proposes a **Bayesian predictive framework** to estimate regions with a high probability of shark feeding activity (*feeding hotspots*) based on environmental and behavioral variables.
The goal is to provide a technical foundation for integrating **deep telemetry data** with **satellite-derived oceanographic information**, contributing to the identification and prediction of movement patterns and feeding behavior in large marine predators.

The simulation was entirely developed in **Python**, using the **PyMC** library for Bayesian inference and **Matplotlib** for spatial visualization.

---

## **üß© Model Architecture**

The core of the model is a **Bayesian logistic regression**, calibrated with synthetic data that emulate real environmental conditions obtained from satellite sensors.
The probabilistic formulation aims to estimate the likelihood of a feeding event (binary variable `y = 1`) as a function of environmental and physiological variables recorded by a sensor tag.

The base equation follows:

[
P(y_i = 1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_T T_i + \beta_P P_i + \beta_S S_i + \beta_D D_i)}}
]

where:

* ( y_i ) ‚Äî feeding event (1 = occurred, 0 = not occurred);
* ( T_i, P_i, S_i, D_i ) ‚Äî environmental variables associated with observation ( i );
* ( \beta_0, \beta_T, \beta_P, \beta_S, \beta_D ) ‚Äî parameters inferred via MCMC sampling in PyMC.

Inference is performed using the **NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler)** algorithm ‚Äî the standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method in modern Bayesian models ‚Äî ensuring stable convergence and efficient sampling of the posterior space.

## **üìà Modeled Variables**

| Variable           | Description                   | Unit  | Source (real/synthetic)                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `temp`             | Water temperature             | ¬∞C    | Derived from thermal sensors (e.g., MODIS, PACE)      |
| `plancton`         | Phytoplankton concentration   | mg/m¬≥ | Biological proxy for prey abundance (satellite)       |
| `salinidade`       | Surface salinity              | PSU   | Measured by L-band radiometers (e.g., SMAP, Aquarius) |
| `profundidade`     | Maximum estimated depth       | m     | Animal pressure tag data                              |
| `g_event`          | Acceleration or G-force event | m/s¬≤  | Captured by the onboard accelerometer                 |
| `temp_min`         | Minimum temperature at depth  | ¬∞C    | Internal thermal sensor from the tag                  |
| `feed_consistency` | Feeding consistency index     | 1‚Äì3   | Estimated via underwater audio (embedded AI)          |

> **Note:** In this simplified version, the model uses only the main environmental variables (`temp`, `plancton`, `salinidade`, `profundidade`) to maintain computational efficiency in Google Colab.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Pipeline**

1. **Generation of synthetic environmental data**
   Temperature, salinity, phytoplankton, and depth fields are generated over a continuous lat-long grid, with light Gaussian noise and sinusoidal patterns simulating real ocean gradients.

2. **Creation of observation samples (surfacing points)**
   600 random points are selected from the grid, representing shark location transmissions (pings).

3. **Simulation of feeding events**
   A set of ‚Äútrue‚Äù coefficients (`Œ≤_true`) is defined, and event probability is computed using the logistic function.
   Binary feeding events (`y_feed`) are then generated via Bernoulli sampling.

4. **Bayesian inference via PyMC**
   The model is fitted through posterior inference (`pm.sample`), obtaining probability distributions for each coefficient (`Œ≤`).
   This allows not only behavioral prediction but also **quantification of uncertainty** for each variable.

5. **Spatial probability mapping**
   The grid is re-evaluated using posterior samples, producing a **mean probability map** (`prob_map`) that indicates areas with higher feeding likelihood.

6. **Prediction of the next movement point**
   The shark‚Äôs current position is used as a reference, and the algorithm searches for the **local maximum probability** within a search radius, simulating the likely direction of movement.

## **üìä Visual Output**

The result is a **continuous posterior probability map**, where:

* **Deep red** ‚Üí high probability of feeding behavior.
* **Dark blue** ‚Üí low probability.
* **Green dots** ‚Üí current shark positions.
* **Pink ‚ÄúX‚Äù markers** ‚Üí next predicted positions.
* **Pink lines** ‚Üí predicted trajectory (movement vector).

This type of visualization can be correlated with real satellite and biotelemetry tag data for scientific validation.

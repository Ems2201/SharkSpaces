# ü¶à Sharks-from-Space: Bayesian Predictive Model of Feeding Hotspots

## **üåêOverview**

This project proposes a **Bayesian predictive framework** to estimate regions with a high probability of shark feeding activity (*feeding hotspots*) based on environmental and behavioral variables.
The goal is to provide a technical foundation for integrating **deep telemetry data** with **satellite-derived oceanographic information**, contributing to the identification and prediction of movement patterns and feeding behavior in large marine predators.

The simulation was entirely developed in **Python**, using the **PyMC** library for Bayesian inference and **Matplotlib** for spatial visualization.

---

## **üß© Model Architecture**

The core of the model is a **Bayesian logistic regression**, calibrated with synthetic data that emulate real environmental conditions obtained from satellite sensors.
The probabilistic formulation aims to estimate the likelihood of a feeding event (binary variable `y = 1`) as a function of environmental and physiological variables recorded by a sensor tag.

The base equation follows:

[
P(y_i = 1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_T T_i + \beta_P P_i + \beta_S S_i + \beta_D D_i)}}
]

where:

* ( y_i ) ‚Äî feeding event (1 = occurred, 0 = not occurred);
* ( T_i, P_i, S_i, D_i ) ‚Äî environmental variables associated with observation ( i );
* ( \beta_0, \beta_T, \beta_P, \beta_S, \beta_D ) ‚Äî parameters inferred via MCMC sampling in PyMC.

Inference is performed using the **NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler)** algorithm ‚Äî the standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method in modern Bayesian models ‚Äî ensuring stable convergence and efficient sampling of the posterior space.

## **üìà Modeled Variables**

| Variable           | Description                   | Unit  | Source (real/synthetic)                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `temp`             | Water temperature             | ¬∞C    | Derived from thermal sensors (e.g., MODIS, PACE)      |
| `plancton`         | Phytoplankton concentration   | mg/m¬≥ | Biological proxy for prey abundance (satellite)       |
| `salinidade`       | Surface salinity              | PSU   | Measured by L-band radiometers (e.g., SMAP, Aquarius) |
| `profundidade`     | Maximum estimated depth       | m     | Animal pressure tag data                              |
| `g_event`          | Acceleration or G-force event | m/s¬≤  | Captured by the onboard accelerometer                 |
| `temp_min`         | Minimum temperature at depth  | ¬∞C    | Internal thermal sensor from the tag                  |
| `feed_consistency` | Feeding consistency index     | 1‚Äì3   | Estimated via underwater audio (embedded AI)          |

> **Note:** In this simplified version, the model uses only the main environmental variables (`temp`, `plancton`, `salinidade`, `profundidade`) to maintain computational efficiency in Google Colab.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Pipeline**

1. **Generation of synthetic environmental data**
   Temperature, salinity, phytoplankton, and depth fields are generated over a continuous lat-long grid, with light Gaussian noise and sinusoidal patterns simulating real ocean gradients.

2. **Creation of observation samples (surfacing points)**
   600 random points are selected from the grid, representing shark location transmissions (pings).

3. **Simulation of feeding events**
   A set of ‚Äútrue‚Äù coefficients (`Œ≤_true`) is defined, and event probability is computed using the logistic function.
   Binary feeding events (`y_feed`) are then generated via Bernoulli sampling.

4. **Bayesian inference via PyMC**
   The model is fitted through posterior inference (`pm.sample`), obtaining probability distributions for each coefficient (`Œ≤`).
   This allows not only behavioral prediction but also **quantification of uncertainty** for each variable.

5. **Spatial probability mapping**
   The grid is re-evaluated using posterior samples, producing a **mean probability map** (`prob_map`) that indicates areas with higher feeding likelihood.

6. **Prediction of the next movement point**
   The shark‚Äôs current position is used as a reference, and the algorithm searches for the **local maximum probability** within a search radius, simulating the likely direction of movement.

---

## **üìä Visual Output**

The result is a **continuous posterior probability map**, where:

* **Deep red** ‚Üí high probability of feeding behavior.
* **Dark blue** ‚Üí low probability.
* **Green dots** ‚Üí current shark positions.
* **Pink ‚ÄúX‚Äù markers** ‚Üí next predicted positions.
* **Pink lines** ‚Üí predicted trajectory (movement vector).

This type of visualization can be correlated with real satellite and biotelemetry tag data for scientific validation.

* **Commercial integrated product:** **Wildlife Computers SPLASH-F / SPLASH10-F (Fastloc¬Æ + Argos)**

  * **Why:** these commercial tags combine **Fastloc GPS** (optimized for brief surfacings) with an **Argos transmitter**, enabling summarized data transmission via satellite. They are widely used in marine research and are suitable for direct integration or as technical references. ([wildlifecomputers.com][3])

**Note:** the Fastloc/Argos system is the standard, proven solution for marine wildlife tags that are not recovered, combining accurate positioning and efficient satellite uplink. ([static.wildlifecomputers.com][4])

---

## 3) ‚öôÔ∏è **Microcontroller (control + light inference / TFLM)**

* **STM32L4 series ‚Äî example: STM32L452RET6**

  * **Why:** ultra-low-power MCU with Cortex-M4F core, high energy efficiency, adequate memory (512 kB Flash / 160 kB RAM), and multiple interfaces (I¬≤C/SPI/UART). Ideal for control, compression, and light inference (TinyML / TensorFlow Lite Micro). ([STMicroelectronics][5])
  * **Integration:** operates at 3.3 V; recommended to use independent power domains and interrupt-based activation from IMU/pressure triggers. DMA should be used for continuous hydrophone signal acquisition.
